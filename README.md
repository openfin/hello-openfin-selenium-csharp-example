# Hello OpenFin Selenium Csharp Example

## Overview
Example of C#.NET test code with Chrome Driver on OpenFin Runtime

## Source Code
OpenFinAppTest.cs has sample code for testing HTML5 components and OpenFin javascript adapter in Hello OpenFin demo application.

### Guidelines
Since all HTML5 applications in the OpenFin environment need to be started with OpenFin API, chromeDriver.get(URL) is not supported. Test code needs to start HTML5 app before connecting to Chromedriver.

Given there can be multiple applications/windows active in OpenFin Runtime, tests must begin by selecting the targeted window. Each test script has a function that selects the window by matching it's title.

Since the OpenFin Runtime is started by OpenFinRVM, Chromedriver does not have direct control of the OpenFin Runtime. OpenFin app needs to be started by the test code with SeleniumHelper.LaunchOpenFin(). Once a test is complete, it needs to shut down OpenFin Runtime by running javascript code "fin.desktop.System.exit();". driver.quit() does not shut down OpenFin Runtime since it does not have access.

If tests are run with OpenFin Runtime version 5.x.x.x, a patched version of ChromeDriver is needed.  Execuable of the patched version is included in this repo as chromedriverOF.exe.  It can be selected to run this example by changing ChromeDriverFileName in App.config to chromedriverOF.exe.

In Summary
* Tests must target specific windows
* OpenFin RunTime must be shut down after a test is completed
